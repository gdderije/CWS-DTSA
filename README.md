# Parallel Paessens' Clarke-Wright Savings &ndash Discrete Tree-Seed Algorithm for Optimization of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing benchmark Problems
Optimizing Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem through Modified Discrete Tree-Seed Algorithm with Parallel Paessens' Clarke-Wright Heuristic

In this study, we proposed the use of the modified Discrete Tree-Seed Algorithm with the Parallel Paessens' Clarke-Wright Savings (CWS-DTSA) in optimizing Capacitated Vehicle Routing benchmark problems (CVRP). The control parameters considered are the search tendency *ST* and population size *N*. The additional parameters in the algorithm include the *route shape* parameter λ and *correction term* μ which were used to solve for the savings matrix of the Clarke-Wright Savings algorithm.

For each benchmark problem of the CVRP, the fleet size is **homogeneous** which means that the vehicle capacity is the same for all vehicles. Various number of customers were considered ranging from 16 to 121 customers with different vehicle capacities *Q* and demands
